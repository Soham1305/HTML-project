React.js is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces. 
It allows developers to build web applications that can update 
and render efficiently in response to changes in data, without
requiring a full page reload. React uses a virtual DOM, which 
optimizes updates by only changing the parts of the UI that have
actually changed, rather than re-rendering the entire page. 
This can improve the performance and user experience of web applications.

5. Node JS : node.js full course for beginners | complete all - in - one tutorial  -- 6:50:41

Node.js is a JavaScript runtime that allows developers to run JavaScript on the server-side. It provides an event-driven, non-blocking I/O model, making it well-suited for building scalable, high-performance network applications.

Learning Node.js can help you in the following ways:

    Full-stack development: Node.js allows you to use JavaScript for both the front-end and back-end of web development, making it a popular choice for full-stack developers.

    High-performance network applications: Node.js's non-blocking I/O model makes it well-suited for building high-performance network applications such as real-time chat systems and online games.

    High scalability: Node.js is designed to handle large numbers of simultaneous connections, making it a good choice for building highly-scalable applications.

    Widely supported: Node.js has a large and active community and is supported by major companies such as IBM, Microsoft, and PayPal. This means that there are many resources available for learning and many potential job opportunities.

    Large ecosystem: Node.js has a large ecosystem of libraries and tools, such as Express.js, a popular framework for building web applications, and npm, a package manager for JavaScript.

These are some of the reasons why you may want to learn Node.js. However, it's important to note that Node.js is not the only solution for building network applications and web development, and other technologies may be more suitable for certain use cases.

what is  Node.js's non-blocking I/O model 

Node.js's non-blocking I/O model refers to the way that Node.js handles input/output (I/O) operations, such as reading or writing data to a file or a database.

In a traditional, blocking I/O model, when a program wants to perform an I/O operation, it stops executing and waits for the operation to complete before continuing. This can cause the program to be unresponsive while it's waiting for the I/O operation to complete, and can limit the program's ability to handle multiple I/O operations at the same time.

In contrast, Node.js uses a non-blocking I/O model, which means that when a program wants to perform an I/O operation, it initiates the operation and then continues to execute other code, rather than waiting for the operation to complete. This allows the program to handle multiple I/O operations at the same time, without being blocked by any single operation.

Node.js achieves this through the use of callbacks, which are functions that are called when an I/O operation is complete. When the program initiates an I/O operation, it provides a callback function that will be called when the operation is complete. This allows the program to continue executing other code while the I/O operation is in progress, and to be notified when the operation is complete.

This non-blocking I/O model allows Node.js to handle many simultaneous connections and to perform multiple I/O operations at the same time. This makes it well-suited for building high-performance, highly-scalable network applications such as real-time chat systems, online games and other applications that need to handle a high volume of I/O operations.


6.Redux  :  React Redux full course for bedinners | redux toolkit complete tutorial  -- 4:00:00

Redux is a JavaScript library that is often used in conjunction with React.js to manage the state of a web application. It provides a centralized store for application state, and a set of rules for updating that state in a predictable and controlled manner.

The main use of Redux is to manage the state of a web application in a centralized and predictable way. This can make it easier to understand how the different parts of a web application are interacting, and can make it easier to debug and test the application.

Redux uses a combination of actions, reducers, and the store to manage state.
Actions are objects that describe an event that has occurred in the application, such as a button click or a form submission.
Reducers are pure functions that take the current state of the application and an action, and return the new state of the application.
The store is an object that holds the current state of the application and allows the application to dispatch actions to update the state.

One of the main advantages of Redux is that it makes it easy to maintain a consistent state across multiple components in a React application. By centralizing state management in a single store, it becomes easier to track and manage the flow of data between different parts of the application.

It also allows for time travel debugging, where you can move backwards and forwards through the different states of the application and see how the data changed over time.

Overall, Redux can be a powerful tool for managing the state of complex web applications, and is particularly well-suited for use with React.js.


7. Type script  : Type - script full course for beginners | complete all in one tutorial  -- 8:21:57

TypeScript is a programming language that is a superset of JavaScript. It adds optional static typing and other features to JavaScript, making it more suitable for large-scale web development projects. TypeScript can be used in web development to improve code quality, maintainability, and scalability by catching errors early and providing better code organization.
